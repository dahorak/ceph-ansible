Testing
=======
ceph-ansible has the ability to test different scenarios (collocated journals
or dmcrypt OSDs for example) in an isolated, repeatable, and easy way.

These tests can run locally with VirtualBox or via libvirt if available, which
removes the need to solely rely on a CI system like Jenkins to verify
a behavior.
